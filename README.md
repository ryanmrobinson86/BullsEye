========

iOS basic game where the user is asked to move a slider as close to a target value as possible. When the user hits the "Hit Me" button the actual value will be compared to the target value and a score will be calculated and added to the the users total.

The game only ends when the user either starts over or quits the app.

The game concept was taken from Ray Wenderlich's iOS Apprentice Tutorial but has been adapted by me for my own education/enjoyment.

Feel free to borrow from this if you wish.
